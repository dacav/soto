   This project is meant to be part of the exam I'm taking in Real Time
                     Operating System and Middleware.

Compliation and dependency:

    This project depends on the following libraries:
    -> Alsa asoundlib                         http://www.alsa-project.org/
    -> GNU libplot                  http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/
    -> libdacav                  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libdacav/

    The compilation is uses the standard autotools process. See the
    INSTALL file for detailed information.

    The "configure" script accepts the following extra configuration options:

    --enable-debug     :    Enables the DEBUG_* macros defined in
                            src/headers/logging.h giving a greater level
                            of verbosity;

    --disable-realtime :    Disables the priority assignment and other
                            real-time related features. This allows the
                            non-root user to execute the program, but
                            increases the latency and the probability of
                            missing the deadlines.
